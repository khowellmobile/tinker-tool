# Webpage Component Sandbox

This repository contains a simple web-based sandbox that allows developers to create and experiment with various webpage components in real-time. It's designed for easy testing and customization of CSS, sliders, buttons, and other elements directly in the browser. Only CSS can be controlled from the browser but all customizations are persistent for the session.

## Features

- **CSS Customization**: Type custom CSS into a textarea and apply it to the page.
- **Sliders**: Add and adjust range sliders with real-time changes to CSS properties.
- **Buttons**: Add and configure buttons to run functions easily.
- **Tree View**: Visualize the DOM structure of your webpage components.
- **Settings**: basic settings such as changing background color or display modes.

## Files

- `index.html`: The main HTML structure of the sandbox.
- `tinker_script.js`: JavaScript that handles the functionality of the sandbox, including interactions with sliders, buttons, and storage.
- `common_style.css` / `tinker_style.css`: Styles for the sandbox interface and the webpage components.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Start a local web development server
3. Open the server in your broswer and start create components.
